                        Iterate with JavaScript While Loops
You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.

The first type of loop we will learn is called a while loop because 
it runs while a specified condition is true and stops once that condition is no longer true.

// const ourArray = [];
// let i = 0;
// while (i<5) {
//     console.log(i);
//     i++;

Add the numbers 5 through 0 (inclusive) in descending order to myArray using a while loop.

// Answer

const myArray = [];
let a = 5;  // replace all a with i and then submit it
while (a >=0){
    console.log(myArray(a));
    a--;
}
