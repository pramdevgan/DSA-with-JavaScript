    <h3>Create a Module Script </h3>
<p>JavaScript started with a small role to play on an otherwise mostly HTML web. <br>
    Today, it’s huge, and some websites are built almost entirely with JavaScript. <br>
    In order to make JavaScript more modular, clean, and maintainable; <br>
    ES6 introduced a way to easily share code among JavaScript files. <br>
    This involves exporting parts of a file for use in one or more other files, and importing the parts you need, where you need them. <br>
    In order to take advantage of this functionality, you need to create a script in your HTML document with a type of module. <br>
    Here’s an example: </p>
    <pre style="color:blueviolet">
        &ltscript type="module src="filename.js"&gt &lt/script&gt
    </pre>
    <p>
        A script that uses this module type can now use the import and export features you will learn about in the upcoming challenges.
    </p>
    <script type="module" src="index.js">
        
    </script>
