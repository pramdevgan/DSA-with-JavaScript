                                Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator
In JavaScript, when the + operator is used with a String value, it is called the concatenation operator. 
You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together.

Note: Watch out for spaces. 
Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings,
