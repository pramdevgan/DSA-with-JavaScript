Constructing Strings with Variables
Sometimes you will need to build a string, Mad Libs style. 
By using the concatenation operator (+), 
you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.

Example:                                   
                                    */

const ourName = "FreeCodeCamp";
const ourStr3 = "hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?"
console.log(ourStr3);

                                    /*
ourStr would have a value of the string Hello, our name is freeCodeCamp, how are you?.                                    
                                    */
                                   /*
