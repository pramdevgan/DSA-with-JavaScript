/*
Number is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data.

Now let's try to add two numbers using JavaScript.

JavaScript uses the + symbol as an addition operator when placed between two numbers.*/

// Example:
myVar = 5 + 10;
// myVar now has the value 15.


/* 
    Question = Change the 0 so that sum will equal 20
    var sum = 10 + 0;
