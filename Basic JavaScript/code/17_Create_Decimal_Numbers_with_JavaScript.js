Create Decimal Numbers with JavaScript
We can store decimal numbers in variables too. 
Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as floating point numbers or floats.

Note: Not all real numbers can accurately be represented in floating point. 
This can lead to rounding errors.*/

const ourDecimal = 5.7;

// Only change code below this line
const myDecimal = 10.853;
console.log(myDecimal,"\n",ourDecimal);
