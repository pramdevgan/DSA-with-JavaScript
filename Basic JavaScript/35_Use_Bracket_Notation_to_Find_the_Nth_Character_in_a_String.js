Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String
You can also use bracket notation to get the character at other positions within a string.

Remember that computers start counting at 0, 
so the first character is actually the zeroth character.

// Example:

const firstName2 = "Ada";
const secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName2 [1];
console.log(secondLetterOfFirstName);

// secondLetterOfFirstName would have a value of the string d.

                                Question:
Let's try to set thirdLetterOfLastName to equal the 
third letter of the lastName variable using bracket notation.

Hint: Try looking at the example above if you get stuck.

                        // Change the lastName2 variable to lastName;
// Setup
const lastName2 = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
const thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName2[2]; // Change this line
console.log(thirdLetterOfLastName);
