/*Increment a Number with JavaScript
You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the ++ operator.*/

// i++;
// is the equivalent of

// i = i + 1;
/*

Note: The entire line becomes i++;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.*/

/* 
                    Question:

Change the code to use the ++ operator on myVar.*/
